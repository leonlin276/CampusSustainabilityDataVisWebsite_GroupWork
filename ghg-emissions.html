                        <p>From 2005 to 2019, the graph illustrates a striking narrative of GHG Emissions in Boston. Notably, Boston Public Schools lead the pack, emitting more than Public Works and even the Police. This underscores the significant environmental footprint our educational institutions leave behind â€” a sobering reminder that the places we learn also have much to learn about sustainability. As students and members of this community, these numbers should prompt us to act. Our schools are more than just centers of knowledge; they should also be exemplars of sustainable practices. This is not a distant issue but one that impacts us directly, urging each student to be conscious and proactive in mitigating GHG Emissions.</p>

                        It displays the annual MT eCO2 levels of Northeastern University. Fortunately, there were no missing values or outliers during the creation process, and all the data is complete. Through this plot, you can gain insight into the overall changes in carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions from our university, understanding that the school has consistently been making its contributions to sustainability. It shows that the campus' greenhouse gas emissions have been continuously decreasing. We inspire every student to participate in sustainability-related research questions. It sets a broader context, making everyone realize that while the school is taking action, we too are on the path to taking action.
