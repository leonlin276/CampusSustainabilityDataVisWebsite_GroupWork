                  <p>Creating waste is an everyday occurrance for the average student, faculty, and staff on campus. There are three main categories for waste at Northeastern: compost (food and organic material), recycling (waste that's converted into reusable material), and disposal (or trash that ends up in a landfill).
                     Northeastern facilities works hard to collect and properly dispose of our waste, deliberately
                     reducing contamination, sorting, recycling and reusing when possible. </p>

                           decreased since 2019. </strong> The dramatic dip during 2020 is indicative of
                     pandemic conditions. Beginning March of 2020, campuses around the world became empty in response to
                     the burgeoning public health crisis. Ever since, waste has ever so slightly increased as students, faculty and staff return to the campus.
                  <p class="grid-item1 increased"> More notably, <strong> compost waste has surpassed recycling waste.
                     </strong> This shift is promising in the University’s pursuits for more sustainable practices.
