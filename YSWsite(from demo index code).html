      <h1> The Truth about Sustainability at Northeastern </h1>
      <h2> What does sustainability look like? </h2>

      <p> With a population of over 22,000 students <sup>[1]</sup>, day-to-day activities on campus result in waste production and energy use. As faculty, students and staff it's easy to ignore our own contributions to waste production on campus. However, our facilities team and the university work hard to minimize waste and create disposal procedures that promote a circular consumption environment. <p> 

      </p>Our goal with this website is to elucidate the data that are available regarding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, Waste & Recycling, and Compost on campus to make it more accessible for all. <p>

      </p> <i>What do these data tell us, and how can we move toward a more sustainable culture on campus?</i> <p>

      </p>Our visualizations will ideally appeal to the students, faculty and the surrounding community and inspire us to fight for a cleaner future.</p>
