      <div class= "summary_overview" >
        <div class="section1" >
           <p> With a population of over 22,000 students, day-to-day activities on Northeastern University's campus result in copious amounts of waste production and energy use. As faculty, students and staff proccupied with collegiate happenings, it's easy to ignore our own contributions to waste on campus. Fortunately, our facilities team and university policies work dilligently to minimize waste and create disposal procedures that promote a circular consumption environment.</p>
              Our goal with this website is to elucidate the data that are available regarding 
              <a href="ghg-emissions.html" target="_blank" class= "link1" overflow-wrap: break-word;> Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, </a> 
              <a href="waste-and-recycling.html" target="_blank" class= "link1" overflow-wrap: break-word;> Waste & Recycling, </a> and 
              <a href="food-composting.html" target="_blank" class= "link1" overflow-wrap: break-word;> Compost </a> 
           on campus to make it more accessible for all. We believe it's important to cultivate a culture of transparency and mutual respect between the Northeastern Community and facilitiess. 
        </div>
        <div class="question" >
        </p> <strong><i>What do these data tell us, and how can we move toward a more sustainable culture on campus?</i></strong> <p> </div>
        <div class="section2" >
        </p>Our visualizations will ideally appeal to the students, faculty and the surrounding community and inspire us to fight for a cleaner future. Ultimately, we must work together to combat the overcompsumption and climte crisis in the United States and beyond. Northeastern's global reach has the ability to make real change, one alumni and campus at a time. </p> &nbsp; </div>

            Northeastern University is on track to meet our commitment of 80% reduction in Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent (MTCO2e) emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 on a gross square foot (gsf) basis of facilities-controlled buildings and transportation. Facilities Management is deeply committed to achieving these goals.

            Northeastern recognizes the importance of composting for waste management. Facilities Waste & Recycling has collaborated for over a decade with Northeastern Dining Services to fully integrate composting and waste reduction in the main dining areas on the Boston Campus.

            Goals are to preserve the environment, reduce the cost of waste disposal, and keep the design of the program simple and convenient to maintain university wide commitment. To help achieve this, Northeastern uses a multi-stream recycling system.
