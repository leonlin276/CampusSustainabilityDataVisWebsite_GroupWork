        Every day on the campus of Northeastern University, a substantial amount of food is both produced and consumed. Unfortunately, concurrently, there is a significant amount of food wastage. Composting emerges as a viable solution, involving the transformation of organic materials, such as fruit and vegetable scraps, into nutrient-rich soil suitable for gardening and farming. Through composting, the university can diminish its environmental footprint, decrease waste disposal costs, and contribute to local food systems.

        According to Northeastern, the food waste collected on campus is transported to local farms for land-based composting or undergoes processing in an anaerobic digester alongside other agricultural wastes. Presently, Northeastern's food waste is directed to the Hidden Acre Farms composting facility in Medway, MA (Composting at Northeastern, 2023).

            This graph illustrates the aggregate food composting figures across 12 dining locations at Northeastern University in 2022. Noticeably, there is a substantial variance in the quantity of food composted at different locations. Stetson West Loading Dock, weighing in at 898,486 pounds, holds a commanding lead, doubling the amount of the second-ranking location. This discrepancy could be attributed to factors such as foot traffic, catering services, composting facilities, among others, unique to each location.

            This graph depicts the monthly food composting volumes across the campus from the inception of 2021 to the mid-point of 2023. The quantity of food composted exhibits periodic fluctuations, correlating with the seasons. Peak points are evidently aligned with holiday months or the commencement of new terms, while valleys coincide with winter and summer breaks. This pattern suggests a potential correlation with increased food provision by dining halls during peak periods, subsequently leading to higher food waste generation.

          Each orange dot on the graph represents the daily total of food composted at various locations across the campus. The accompanying yellow box plots provide a statistical analysis encompassing the range, average, and special values, offering insights into the daily dynamics of food composting. Every few months, there are consistently a few days when the amount of food composted on campus is remarkably high, indicating substantial food wastage on those occasions.

            For example, on September 10, 2021, the daily composting quantity soared to 15,903.44 pounds. Perhaps this surge is attributed to the celebration of a new campus return after the pandemic. Over the past two years, there have been many similar days, forming numerous data points that deviate from the average range. These outliers may suggest the celebration and festive atmosphere of special holidays, highlighting the associated sustainability costs.

        Having gained an overview of the campus's general composting trends, let's now delve into the daily data of locations with substantial composting quantities. Starting from the smallest to the largest, we have Marino/Speare Loading Dock, Curry/ELL Compactor Area, INV Loading Dock, and the most prominent, Stetson West Loading Dock.

          The fluctuation patterns seem remarkably similar across these locations, yet there are substantial variations in composting quantities, with some even doubling. Comparing 2021 to 2022, there appears to be a decrease in food composting volumes, particularly noticeable in locations other than Curry Student Center.
